South Africa have delayed their team announcement for the Tri-Nations rugby clash against Australia on Saturday in Durban because of injury concerns over their loose forwards. Pierre Spies (groin), Danie Rossouw (illness) and Willem Alberts (back) are all struggling forcing coach Peter de Villiers to only name his side on Thursday - 48 hours later than expected. Ashley Johnson from the Cheetahs and Ryan Kankowski have been called in as cover in the meantime, but prior to their arrival Jean Deysel was the only fully-fit back row forward available. â€“ Sapa
