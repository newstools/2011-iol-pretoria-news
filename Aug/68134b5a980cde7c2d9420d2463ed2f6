Gautrain striking bus drivers will return to work on Wednesday, the company said. “It is therefore anticipated that all train and bus services will operate normally per schedule from tomorrow  (Wednesday),” said  Bombela spokesman Errol Braithwaite in a statement on Tuesday. “Gautrain once again apologises to those customers who were inconvenienced by the illegal strike action yesterday  (Monday).” On Monday, the SA Transport and Allied Workers' Union (Satawu) said about 400 bus drivers contracted to the Gautrain may strike if  a salary dispute was not resolved. “The Mega Express bus drivers earn about R4000 per month. It's not enough for the high standard of living,” the union's provincial  chairman Ephraim Mphahlele said. Mega Express is the only bus service contracted to ferry commuters to and from Gautrain stations. “We are engaging with employers for decent salaries, and if it is not settled then workers will embark on a protected strike.” The union said Monday's illegal strike by some drivers was regrettable. “Satawu strongly condemns this action,” Mphahlele said in a statement. Satawu could immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. - Sapa
